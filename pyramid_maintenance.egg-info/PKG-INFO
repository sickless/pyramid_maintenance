        What is it
        ----------
        
        pyramid_maintenance is a pyramid tween.
        
        This tween gives you the possibility to put an application in maintenance mode (rendering only one specific template for all routes), but let a 'normal' access to your application for users who have specific permission(s).
        
        
        How to install it
        -----------------
        ::
        
            pip install pyramid_maintenance
        
        
        How to enable it
        ----------------
        
        If you want to enable pyramid_maintenance tween in your pyramid app, you have to add in your .ini file::
        
            pyramid.tweens = pyramid_maintenance.tween_maintenance
        
        
        And define the following settings::
        
            # List of permissions (separeted by comma, space, carriage return and/or new line).
            # The pyramid app isn't in maintenance mode for people who have one of these permissions.
            pyramid_maintenance.permissions = permission1, permission2
            # Relative path from defined template location directories.
            pyramid_maintenance.template = template.mako
