----------

pyramid_maintenance is a pyramid tween.

This tween gives you the possibility to put an application in maintenance mode (rendering only one specific template for all routes), but let a 'normal' access to your application for users who have specific permission(s).


How to install it
-----------------
::

    pip install pyramid_maintenance


How to enable it
----------------

If you want to enable pyramid_maintenance tween in your pyramid app, you have to add in your .ini file::

    pyramid.tweens = pyramid_maintenance.tween_maintenance


And define the following settings::

    # List of permissions (separeted by comma, space, carriage return and/or new line).
    # The pyramid app isn't in maintenance mode for people who have one of these permissions.
    pyramid_maintenance.permissions = permission1, permission2
    # Relative path from defined template location directories.
    pyramid_maintenance.template = template.mako
